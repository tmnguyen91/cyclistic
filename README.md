Note: Cyclistic is a fictional company used for the purpose of this case study.  
### Business understanding  
Cyclistic is a very successful bike rental platform in Chicago that has more than 5.2 million trips made in 2022. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.  
Cyclistic is looking for a way to convert its casual riders to annual members and the marketing analyst wants a better understanding of their customers.   

### Summary  
Although casual riders and annual members are the most active during summertime, there are some distinctions between the ways casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes. The marketing department can come up with some better ways to increase the chance of converting casual riders to members.
